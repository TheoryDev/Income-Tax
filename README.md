# Java program to calculate income tax. It asks the user to input their salary and it then prints the tax calculated

`This single script is best compiled and run on the command line (in linux)`

The program calculates the tax the user will pay according to the tax bands from a few years back.

The program only takes into account tax and not national insurance contributions, student loans or council tax.
